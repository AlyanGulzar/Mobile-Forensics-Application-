# Mobile Forensics Tool

The Mobile Forensics Tool is a GUI-based application built with Python and `ttkbootstrap`. It leverages **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)** to extract forensic artifacts from Android devices in real-time. The tool provides access to device information, logs, app data, network status, and more, making it ideal for mobile forensics analysis and lawful investigations.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or download this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mobile-forensics-tool.git
   cd mobile-forensics-tool
   ```

2. **Run the tool:**

   ```bash
   python mobileforensics.py
   ```

3. **Interact with the GUI:**

   - Use the tabs to navigate between features (`Device Info`, `Logs`, `Network`, etc.)
   - Click buttons to extract or view information
   - Output will be displayed in the main output window

## Use Cases

- Forensic analysis of Android devices
- Incident response investigations
- Data recovery and evidence extraction
- App behavior inspection

## Limitations

- Root access is not guaranteed and depends on the target device.
- Some files and app data may be inaccessible on non-rooted devices.
- SMS and call log access may be restricted on newer Android versions due to permission model changes.
- Some ADB features require device to be in unlocked bootloader state.

## Troubleshooting

- **Device shows "unauthorized" in `adb devices`:**  
  Reconnect device and accept the USB debugging prompt on the phone.

- **Device not listed:**  
  Check cable and USB mode (should be "File Transfer" or "Transferring files").

- **Restart ADB:**

  ```bash
  adb kill-server
  adb start-server
  ```
